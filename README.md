# Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries

In this task I practice how to write SQL queries using SELECT command.  
I created table called `customers` and add some dummy data.  
Then I try different queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIKE, BETWEEN and LIMIT.

I use DB Browser for SQLite to run this queries.

## What I Learn

- how to select data from table
- how to filter data with WHERE
- how to use AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN
- how to sort data using ORDER BY
- how to limit results using LIMIT

## Files

- `task3_select_queries.sql` â€“ all the SQL queries I wrote for this task
